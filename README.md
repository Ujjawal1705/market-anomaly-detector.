Market Anomaly Detector

This project is my submission for the GenAI Hackathon 2025 (Pathway x IIT Ropar).
The idea is simple: build a system that can automatically detect unusual patterns in data — something that can save time, avoid mistakes, and help in better decision-making.

Problem We Looked At

When you’re dealing with large inventories (police equipment, market goods, or supply chain resources), it’s almost impossible to track everything manually.

Sometimes resources get misused.

Sometimes stock goes missing.

Sometimes usage patterns just don’t make sense.

Doing this manually is not only slow, but also error-prone. That’s the exact pain point we wanted to solve.

What We Built

Our solution focuses on three things:

✅ Detect anomalies in data (like sudden shortages, irregular usage, or unusual spikes).
✅ Provide easy-to-understand graphs so users don’t just see numbers, but also trends.
✅ Build a system that can scale — not just for one dataset, but across domains like police inventory, warehouses, hospitals, and retail.

We also designed a simple UI demo to show how the results can be visualized in real time.

Example Use Case

Imagine a police department suddenly running out of walkie-talkies during an emergency.
Not because the devices weren’t available — but because no one noticed the unusual consumption pattern earlier.

That’s exactly the type of problem our anomaly detector can highlight before it becomes critical.

Tech Stack

Python – core logic & anomaly detection

Pandas / NumPy – data handling & preprocessing

Matplotlib / Seaborn – visualizations & trend graphs

Streamlit (or Flask) – lightweight demo UI

Why This Matters

This project isn’t just about catching missing stock.
It’s about trust and efficiency — making sure that important resources are used properly and available when needed.

In the future, we see this system being applied to:

Police hardware & logistics

Hospital supplies

Retail & warehouses

Any place where anomalies = losses

✨ Built with the idea that data should work for us, not against us.
